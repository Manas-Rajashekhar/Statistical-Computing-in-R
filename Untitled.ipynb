    "## Question 1 - Probabilities\n",
    "Suppose we are playing a simple collectable card game (e.g. like Hearthstone, or Magic the Gathering). In this game, each player has a card deck which contains 30 cards (with no duplicate cards). At the start of this game, both players shuffle their decks. \n",
    "Then the player going first draws five cards, and the player going second draws six cards. After this, the game starts, and players alternate turns.\n",
    "Each player draws an additional card at the start of their turn. So, for example, after their third turn player one should have drawn\n",
    "eight cards in total (the 5 cards they started with, plus another three cards over three turns). Player two should have drawn nine cards in total after their third turn.\n",
    "For the following questions, suppose there is a special combination of five cards, and if you have those five cards in your hand you instantly win the game."
